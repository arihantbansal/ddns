# Distributed DNS

This repository contains project submission for the course BITS F382 Large Scale Distributed Systems at BITS Goa (conducted by [Prof Arnab Paul](https://arnabkrpaul.github.io/)).

We are implementing a highly-available, replicated, distributed DNS server in Rust. We use Paxos/Raft to ensure consistency across the cluster.
